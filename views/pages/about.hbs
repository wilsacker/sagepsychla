            <h2>Dr. Lisa Acker</h2>
            <p>
                "First and foremost, I am a dedicated and experienced professional providing excellent care for adolescents and adults. I offer personalized care, including evidence-based therapy and psycho-educational assessments. When conducting initial consultations and subsequent sessions, I provide a warm and non-judgemental environment and listen attentively.
            </p>
            <p>
                For over 20 years, I have worked with a diverse array of people, from childhood through adulthood, across the US, and in Hong Kong and England. I work from an integrative perspective, tailoring the therapeutic modality to the expressed goals. My professional and personal experience has provided me with an appreciation of multiple cultures and perspectives and a broad range of treatments and interventions to draw from. My experience spans private practice, top-notch college prep day and boarding schools, and community agencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a licensed Psychologist, with a Doctorate in Psychology and a  Master's degree in Educational Psychology.  In addition, I have completed advanced training in Cognitive Behavior Therapy and Exposure and Response Prevention.
            </p>
            <p>
                On a personal note, and one I am most proud of, I am also the mother of three young adults who are freshly graduated from college and are launching their lives and careers."
