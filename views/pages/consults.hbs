            <h2>How can a Consultation be Helpful?</h2>
            <p>
                When your child’s emotions or behavior feel overwhelming, it’s natural to feel at a loss for what to do. Sitting down with an expert can be incredibly helpful for getting your questions answered, learning more effective strategies, and finding ways to strengthen your relationship with your teen. Consultations can provide guidance for navigating both everyday challenges and traumatic experiences, helping you regain stability and move forward.
